<h1>The Good, The Bad and The Ugly Compliments / Pick-up Lines</h1>

<div class="box">
  <div class="line">• It was like looking at unfounded treasure that all pirates are searching and fighting for.
Or a unique art piece that a famous artist hid away.
Or like Neil Armstrong stepping onto the moon on an uncharted place and planet.
Or unlocking a door to my dreams and aspirations.
Or discovering the lost city of Atlantis.
Or finding a new island like Christopher Columbus.
</div>
  <div class="line">•  I will start off with them thigh since those squishy legs been on mind for a very long time… a couple months… just because you sat on my legs one random day while hangout…😭😭</div>
  <div class="line">• 😏…then hmmm them lips which I have conquered… the one thing loved to have touch since day 1 of us getting together 😭… them lips where hypnotizing… and still is… sometimes I feel like kiss even if people were around…😏hmmmm even that Saturday when we both throw ourselves at each other.. well mainly me being overly greedy and needy😅… it was a amazing day for because got to touch a lot of things like your lips, thighs, waist, hands, and the shape of everything 😏… and seeing the shape of what mines(welllllll eventually hopefully 🙏 ).Might have to cuff me up to not that again… because damnnnn…Nowww… trying get rid of everything physically quicker so that you don’t rebuke my thoughts, actions and feelings.The waist and everything is sooo hmmmm teaaaa as people say it… you body look snatched and beautiful if each outfit you put …😏  like them outfit that is so fitted  like that skirt from that Saturday 😏… even said that it showed almost everything…I seen it.. why you think I was walking a little bit behind😭😭… my eyes were lurking 😅😅😅😅.
Hmmm…you personality is quite wonderful as welll… I knew this and learnt about mature you are compared to me…I was fabricating lies when I said that I was mature for my age… compared to you I was not mature enough for you even now sometimes I feel you deserve better…someone’s who more mature and put together… not someone who shies away and have mood swings.Your quite intelligent and determined  compare to little old me… because I could done better to be by your side when you graduate but I was fooling around..Hmmm… but damnnnn those thigh were soft😏
</div>
  <div class="line">• You look quite beautiful tonight, and I am sorry for not complimenting you earlier. I won't make any excuses for not doing so. Hmmm, now on to the piece may like or not. Them lips playing with that sweet was an interesting encounter that I was expecting. I see untapped potential that can be explored.😉
I was also thinking about them heavy weights that you carry at the front. I won't really talk about it, but I just want you to know that I think about it too. Now on to that fuzzy hair that makes you look like the Grinch who wants to steal Christmas a bit too early😭. And that dress, hmmm...I looks wonderful...you could push back a bit so I could try to see everything...because I haven't seen the full dress/outfit...only the bazonka at the front and the black attire which covers up the jewels.
</div>
  <div class="line">• The camera always faced towards your small little peach-colored lips…the thought of missing another chance and day to kiss or just near…is devastating.
</div>
  <div class="line">• Baby a blind man can see all them assets… thing 1 and thing 2
</div>
  <div class="line">• Only 1 person ass I want to see.. none other than her one… the p shape type of butt…
</div>
  <div class="line">• I like your B sized breast and P shaped ass and legs.</div>
  <div class="line">• I guess started having a infatuation for boobs</div>
    <div class="line">• .I heard that the finest and beautiful people are stupid, are you stupid?</div>
  <div class="line">• You look soooo shorttttt. You look very beautiful love but I have to tease you first</div>
   <div class="line">• You are very cute…and beautiful…and gorgeous…and pretty… and lovely… and sweet… and attractive.. and irresistible… and seductive… and alluring… and enticing… and sexy… and fetching… and winsome…and ravishing… and stunning… and remarkable…and amazing…and adorable… and bewitching…and enchanting… and tempting… and beguiling… and dreamy… and precious… and lovable… and cuddly..and hot… and coquettish
</div>
  <div class="line">• it wasss very very beautiful...mainly with the shorts one of the most interesting thing have worn🙂‍↕️🙂‍↕️🙂‍↕️😏 i will be staringggg</div>
  <div class="line">• I’ve been thinking about you a lot…and how gorgeous you are 😏… Would you be comfortable sending some more sexy photos, if you’re in the mood ? I would love to see more of you, only if you into it…No pressure, I haven’t use this word before, but I believe I should start this because I feel like I am adding a little bit of pressure on the “demand” I guess. Like, remember the thigh, legs, frontal weights and face pictures I wanted.</div>
    <div class="line">• hmmm... she's too thick to ignore, too curvy to forget.thigh enough to tempt, curvy enough to ruin my focus as I watch that thing move left to right.Too fine to pass by, too bold to leave behind (I didn’t make this one I saw it so I give credit to the person)
</div>
  <div class="line">• It looks wonderful. You did a good job doing it even a rush😉</div>
